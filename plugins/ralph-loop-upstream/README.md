# Ralph Loop

Ralph Loop runs Cursor in a self-referential loop, feeding the same prompt back after every turn until the task is complete. It implements the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) pioneered by Geoffrey Huntley.

## How it works

Two hooks drive the loop. An `afterAgentResponse` hook watches each response for a `<promise>` tag matching the completion phrase. A `stop` hook fires when Cursor finishes a turn. If the promise hasn't been detected and the iteration limit hasn't been reached, the stop hook sends the original prompt back as a `followup_message`, starting the next iteration. Cursor sees its own previous edits in the working tree and git history, iterates on them, and repeats. The prompt never changes. The code does.

## Installation

```
/add-plugin ralph-loop
```

## Quick start

> Start a ralph loop: "Build a REST API for todos. CRUD operations, input validation, tests. Output COMPLETE when done." --completion-promise "COMPLETE" --max-iterations 50

Cursor will implement the API, run tests, see failures, fix them, and repeat until all requirements are met.

## Skills

**ralph-loop** starts the loop. Provide a prompt and options:

> Start a ralph loop: "Refactor the cache layer" --max-iterations 20 --completion-promise "DONE"

- `--max-iterations <N>` stops after N iterations (default: unlimited)
- `--completion-promise <text>` sets the phrase that signals completion

**cancel-ralph** removes the state file and stops the loop.

**ralph-loop-help** explains the technique and usage in detail.

## Writing good prompts

Define explicit completion criteria. Vague goals like "make it good" give Cursor nothing to verify against.

```markdown
Build a REST API for todos.

When complete:
- All CRUD endpoints working
- Input validation in place
- Tests passing (coverage > 80%)
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

Break large tasks into phases. Encourage self-correction by including test/fix cycles in the prompt. Always pass `--max-iterations` to prevent runaway loops.

## When to use Ralph Loop

Works well for tasks with clear, verifiable success criteria: getting tests to pass, completing a migration, building a feature from a spec. Not a good fit for tasks that need human judgment or have ambiguous goals.
